This project uses PyTorch and scikit-learn to construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for a challenging multiclass image classification task. The code begins by meticulously importing essential libraries and crafting a custom dataset class to handle data loading and preprocessing. The subsequent sections unveil a meticulously designed CNN architecture, showcasing layers tailored to extract intricate features from input images. The model undergoes training and evaluation, with a focus on assessing its generalization capabilities on a validation set. The research then results in predictions on a test set, and the subsequent submission of results. The final accuracy score serves as a test to the model's efficacy, bringing  a comprehensive exploration of the intersection between deep learning, data manipulation, and classification tasks.
